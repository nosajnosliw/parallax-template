          <h4 class="teal-text text-lighten-1 center">ABSTRACT & HYPOTHESIS</h4>
          <p class="teal-text text-darken-3 left-align">BROTHER is a project that I undertook as my thesis requirement for the Master of Science program in Integrated Digital Media at NYU Poly. I received my degree in May 2013. The project concerns itself with the creation of a multicultural marketing vehicle by way of a digital/mobile media channel that is aligned with the proven advanced digital media usage habits of minority men, gays and blacks specifically. In my paper, I explore a variety of psychological research and media audits to discuss the dismal treatment of young men of color in the media and the proven sub conscious effects of these images on whites (and the whitened) in regards to hiring, voting, shooting young men of color randomly in the street, subsequent murder trial verdicts...</p>

          <p class="teal-text text-darken-3 left-align">I compare the negative media treatment of minority men of color with the inclusive and identity affirming media treatment of gays in order to justify a media outlet that attempts to redefine the American male mainstream in the face of our rapidly changing population demographic. My thesis then goes on to explore a variety of marketing data compiled from sources including AdAge, Global Hue, Google, e-marketer.com, The Heinz Foundation et al... to expound on the vitality of the African American and gay consumer market and the necessity for new digital media channels that meet their usage habits and hearken to their particular consumer interests.</p> 

          <p class ="teal-text text-darken-3 left-align">In creating this channel, men of color would then enjoy the media legitimacy (and subsequent political/social benefits) and minority identity affirmation that gays have been able to achieve in recent years, and advertisers would have a means of accessing literally trillions of dollars of untapped economy.</p>

          <h4 class="teal-text text-lighten-1 center">RESEARCH</h4>
          <p class="teal-text text-darken-3 left-align">Along with scouring a variety of scholarly articles concerning media representation of young men of color and gay men, I spent several months digesting a variety of marketing statistics concerning digital media usage, education, earnings and goods consumption habits of African Americans, Latinos and Gays. In an effort to corroborate some of this information I sought out feedback from several of my peers by way of a brief survey.  In some ways this survey could be considered my first MVP, a means of proving my hypothesis, that young gay and ethnic men do in fact feel underrepresented and would in fact read a publication geared towards them and owuld respond favorably to advertisements therein.Please feel free to access it <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/JmVKJtJAkf" target="_blank">here.</a> </p>

          <p class="teal-text text-darken-3 left-align">Of the twenty participants in my survey, eleven were straight, one identified as bi, and eight were gay.  Five of the gay participants identified to some degree with targeted LGBT ads.  Only one reported satisfaction with representation of LGBT men in advertisements.  All of them saw some significance in advertisers diversifying their strategies to mirror the diversifying population. </p> 
          <p class="teal-text text-darken-3 left-align">Half of the users used IOS devices while the other half used blackberry or android for phone usage. All were tablet owners with only two of them using IOS tablets.  The others used Android. Of the straight participants two were mixed-race one identified as others two were caucasian and three identified as African-American/ black. </p> 

          <p class="teal-text text-darken-3 left-align">All reported word of mouth as the most influential factor in their purchase decision making. Of the eleven straight participants, five are caucasian, four were African-American, one identified as Hispanic/Latino and one as mixed race. Eight were tablet owners and 6 owned an iPhone.  All were smartphone users. Only two participants reported uncertainty with subscribing to a magazine with content targeting advertising and editorial content that targeted straight and gay men simultaneously. </p> 

          <p class="teal-text text-darken-3 left-align">I used this feedback in conjunction with my research to create a set of fictitious personas (ProtoPersonas according to the LEAN UX methodology) that would allow me to get a better grasp of the variety of potential users, their individual goals, a brandable design aesthetic, and content requirements that were unique to my particular endeavor.</p>

          <p class="teal-text text-darken-3 left-align">The logo design references historical American slave auction bills using contemporary fonts that are similar to the typography employed in these in antebellum advertisements. Given the nature of my thesis and its main purpose as a marketing vehicle for minority American men, I thought that it would be witty and apt to appropriate this rich though sordid typographical history into my site.</p>

          <img class="outpicasset" style="height:auto; width:auto; min-height:225px; margin: 30px 30px;" src="assets/brother/brotherlogodesign.png"></a>

           <p class="teal-text text-darken-3 left-align">The final logo incorporated seven different fonts (Bodidly, Bodoni, IFCRailroad, Rosewood, Showboat, OldNewspaperType, and LTNutshell) all of which were very similar to the look of the typography in the Antebellum advertisements. The lack of uniformity in the type served to underscore the idea of homogeneity and ownership of our multicultural American History. Themes that were very important in the construction of my editorial philosophy and the construction of my thesis in general.</p>

           <p class="teal-text text-darken-3 left-align">Using Bullett Magazine and VMAN as major inspiration for how I wanted my web page to function, in addition to ideas that still resonanted from the Out.com experiment, I began to sketch out some ideas for the layout of my site.</p>

          <h4 class="teal-text text-lighten-1 center">UX DESIGN</h4>
          <p class="teal-text text-darken-3 left-align">My UX required quite a bit of planning and research. I leaned heavily on the texts of <a href ="http://www.jjg.net/elements/" target="_blank">Jesse James Garrett</a> and his particular approach to UX planning and the flow of information. His text, The Elements of User Experience, was a great guide for me throughout the entire design and ideation process. The idea map and experience flow artifacts that I created based off of Garret's UX Elements were incredibly useful in helping me to understand the design process and the intricacies of creating a user journey.</p>

          <p class="teal-text text-darken-3 left-align">My initial plan was to feature all content by way of modals that would allow the user to never have to leave the homepage essentially. Features would pop up in a lightbox or shadowbox modal format above the main page content. Links to similar stories would be offered in the pop up or the user could simply navigate back to the home page to check out more stories by clicking outside of the modal. Ad spaces with blue boxes.</p>

          <p class="teal-text text-darken-3 left-align">The layout and infinite scrolling content were inspired by popular online men’s fashion publications like VMan, and Hypbeast. I envisioned that initial content for my site would be either syndicated fashion, lifestyle and tech content in coordination with original street fashion photographs of young gay and black men. This in itself is a very simple way to begin to publish positive images of both minorities.</p>

          <h4 class="teal-text text-lighten-1 center">THESIS</h4>
          <p class="teal-text text-darken-3 left-align">My thesis paper compiles the UX research and design that I completed with the years worth of academic, marketing and psychology study to explain how the dearth of positive and enlightening portrayals of African-American men in the media is a detriment to our society. I elucidate through a variety of examples, how the proliferation of negative portrayals of black men in the media further fuel with implicit bias.</p> 

          <p class="teal-text text-darken-3 left-align">I juxtapose this research with marketing information that underscores the reality that African American's, in particular men and young people are some of American's most savvy digital users and early adapters, and have been proven to be trend setters across a variety of consumer and digital goods consumption channels. This data also shows that the 1.4 trillion dollars worth of economy that the African-American population wields is vastly overlooked by the US advertisers. I discuss how inclusion of African-Americans in targeted digital campaigns and products will not only stimulate economic growth as a whole, but can act as a means of validating positive black identity. This point is illustrated through an analysis of treatment of gays in advertising and editorial media and the positive effect that this inclusion had on the formation of popular gay commercial and social identities.</p>

          <p class="teal-text text-darken-3 left-align ">One of the methods that I hypothesized would brign BROTHER to life was by way of a responsive WordPress plug in, Cubrik. Having never worked with Wordpress before, I found that the process of building it was a little more daunting thatn I had anticipated, but I was able to implement the cubrik theme and input a bit of information to envision how my site would gain its legs so to speak.</p>

            <p class="teal-text text-darken-3 left-align ">As 'Mobile First' becomes more an more of a salient tenet in design and development, my ideas about BROTHER have changed since completing my thesis and graduating from NYU Poly. The mobile aspect of the site was very important for me considering that which I had learned from my research, and choosing a theme with responsive capabilities was very crucial. Looking back though, I can imagine that a mobile presence or hybrid page would be much easier to build using Angular or Bootstrap and HTML5 or Polymer.</p>
